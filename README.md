# üì® MailForm

> The lightweight email service for contact forms and more!

This is basically a minimal self-hosted open source alternative to [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) and [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/).

Unlike other mail services (that often gives you an API key for backends), this self-hosted mail service is designed to be accessed directly from a frontend, but also offers you the option to use it as a mail service with configurable API keys.

### Features

- Access via API or HTML form with redirects
- Configurable CORS and Origin restriction
- ReCaptcha and hCaptcha support
- Custom rate limits for every target
- Optional API keys

### Planned features

- [ ] Email Templates
- [x] File Uploads for attachments
- [x] ReCaptcha and hCaptcha support

### Used frameworks & libraries

- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/about/)
- [Validate.js](https://validatejs.org/)
- [rate-limiter-flexible](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rate-limiter-flexible)
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)

```

### Manually

_Requires NodeJS 16 or higher_

git clone https://github.com/Feuerhamster/mailform.git
cd mailform
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

## ‚öôÔ∏èConfiguration

### Application

MailForm can be configured using environment variables.

**Environment variables:**

- `PORT` The port on which the application starts. If not provided, a random port will be selected.
- `TARGETS_DIR` Path to the directory with your target files. Default is `/targets` of the project root.
- `PROXY` A boolean that enables the "trust proxy" option of Express. **Enable this if you're using MailForm behind a reverse proxy like NGINX!** Default value is false.

### Targets

Targets are your different endpoints each with its own rate limits and smtp provider.
They are JSON files placed in the `/targets` directory.

**Example target:**

```json
{
  "smtp": "smtps://username:password@smtp.example.com",
  "origin": "my-website.com",
  "recipients": ["example@example.com"],
  "from": "no-reply@example.com",
  "rateLimit": {
    "timespan": 300,
    "requests": 1
  },
  "captcha": {
    "provider": "hcaptcha",
    "secret": "xxx"
  }
}
```

**Available fields:**

**Required**

- `smtp` | A valid SMTP(S) url.
- `recipients` | An array of email addresses which should receive the email.
- `from` | The default "from" address used as fallback when no `from` is provided in the request. A `from` supplied in the request overrides this value.
- `rateLimit.timespan` | Timespan (in seconds) for the rate limiter to reset.
- `rateLimit.requests` | Allowed amount of requests in the given timespan.

**Optional**

- `origin` | A HTTP origin that is used for CORS and to restrict access. Default is \* if not set.
- `replyTo` | The "replyTo" field of an email. If not provided in the request, it defaults to the effective `from` that is used for the email.
- `subjectPrefix` | A target-wide prefix for the email subject.
- `key` | A string used as API key if you want to restrict access to this target.
- `redirect.success` | A valid relative or absolute URL to redirect the user if the mail was sent successful.
- `redirect.error` | A valid relative or absolute URL to redirect the user if the mail can't be sent due to an error.
- `captcha` | Enables captcha verification for the target.
  - `captcha.provider` _required if captcha_ | The captcha provider ("recaptcha" or "hcaptcha").
  - `captcha.secret` _required if captcha_ | Secret key for your captcha.

For the exact validations of the fields please see here: [target.ts](/src/models/target.ts)

## üì´ Usage

### Fields

Whether as formular data or json, the fields are the same.

**Required**

- `subject` | The email subject.
- `body` | The email body (supports HTML).

**Optional**

- `from` | The email address of the sender. If this field is not set, the target's `from` will be used. If set, it overrides the target's `from`.
- `replyTo` | Reply-to address. If not set, it defaults to the effective `from`.
- `firstName` | A classic first name filed which will be attached to the "from" field of the email.
- `lastName` | A classic last name filed which will be attached to the "from" field of the email.
- `subjectPrefix` | A Prefix for the email subject.

**Only required if the target uses captcha**

- `g-recaptcha-response` | Field for ReCaptcha response.
- `h-captcha-response` | Field for hCaptcha response.

For the exact validations of the fields please see here: [posts.ts](/src/models/post.ts)

**Important info:** If a redirect is configured for your target, it will always return the redirect, even if you make an API call.
If no redirect is set, http status codes will be returned.

### Captchas

MailForm supports both [ReCaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/) and [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/).

To use captchas, you have to configure it in your target.

On a request, the corresponding field (`g-recaptcha-response` for ReCaptcha or `h-captcha-response` for hCaptcha) have to be filled for validation.
If you use the captcha widget in a form, this will happen automatically.
If you use an API request, you have to fill it manually.

### HTML Form

**Example html form:**

```html
<form
  method="post"
  action="https://mailform.yourserver.com/your-target-file-name"
>
  <input type="email" name="from" placeholder="Sender's email address" />
  <input type="text" name="firstName" placeholder="First name" />
  <input type="text" name="lastName" placeholder="Last name" />
  <input type="hidden" name="subjectPrefix" value="[App-Question] " />
  <input type="text" name="subject" placeholder="Subject" />
  <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="your_site_key"></div>
  <textarea name="body" placeholder="Your message"></textarea>
</form>
```

To work properly, you may want to configure a redirect in the target.

### API

Simply make a request to `/:target` (replace with your target's file name).
If you have set an API key, add the HTTP Authorization header with type `Bearer` and then the key.
Make sure to also use the right origin (if not set automatically because the request is from a backend).

> ‚ö† Since the file upload feature got added, there is an Issue with `application/json`. Please use multipart form or form urlencoded for API requests. I am working on a rewrite where this gets fixed.

**Example request:**

```http request
POST https://mailform.yourserver.com/your-target-file-name
Origin: your-configured-origin.com
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer your-optional-api-key

{
  "from": "example@example.com",
  "subject": "your subect",
  "body": "your message",
}
```

**Possible status codes:**

- `200` Email was successfully sent.
- `401` Authentication failed: API key not present or wrong.
- `403` Forbidden because of wrong origin header.
- `404` Target not found.
- `500` Sending the email failed.
